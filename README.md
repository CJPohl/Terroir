# Terroir - 2D Game Engine

---

_The word Terroir derives as a French term used to describe environmental factors that affect a crop's phenotype. These
such crops consist of many of the finer things in life, including wine, tobacco, and even chocolate. All the
characteristics that make up a terroir give the crop a distinctive character. Terroir even references this character._

# CAUTION

Terroir is currently in a **extremely** early state and not recommended now or the considerable future for the use in serious
commercial or hobby projects. The API will undergo considerable changes over this period.

Terroir provides ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Terroir in its primitive, 2D only form (version 1.0) does not support development on macOS or iOS as this is an OpenGL only backend engine. Apple since 2018/2019 have deemed OpenGL depreciated so in the wise words of a Redditor I forgot the name of, I deem that Apple has been depreciated.... But if you wanna try to compile and run on your Mac, go ahead by all means.

Terroir 1.0 is planned to be a simple but powerful tool to create interactive 2D video games and experiences featuring first-class support for both Windows and Linux through OpenGL.

Overall, the main goal is to provide a thorough interface that focuses and emphasizes on ease of development and scalability while maintaining high performance. Because of this, the LuaJIT embedded runtime will be used for scripting in the Terroir engine. Modern C++ as a language has come a long way in terms of memory safety and other productivities, but for most 2D interactive experiences and to take advantage of hot reloading, the LuaJIT will be powerful enough to make the developers dream a reality.

Terroir will also have an Entity Component System (ECS) plugin based API will allow the developer the freedom to modularize how their code is structured as well as providing the foundation in how Terroir manages game data.

## Getting Started

Building Requirements:

- C++20 capable compiler (built and tested on g++ (Unix) and MSVC (Windows))
- CMake (min version 3.0)
- Python 3

Terroir is a statically linked library that is linked at compile time with your chosen executable. Packages are handled through Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html); it has been added as a git submodule under .gitsubmodules. All other dependencies are listed in vcpkg.json.

For both platforms, Terroir has been built and tested using CMake and Visual Studio Code.  If you aren't familiar with these tools, particularly CMake, I recommend learning the basics of these before attempting to fool around with the engine.

Start by cloning the repo.

Cd into the directory and to build simply run:

Unix:
setup.sh

or for Windows:
setup.bat

-- Specific compile info coming soon --

## Road to the Next Vintage - (v0.1)

Terroir (Vintage v0.1), ideally will allow the game developer to successfully create primitive 2D games. These would include classic retro arcade games like pong, tetris, and astroids.
