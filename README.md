# Terroir - 2D Game Engine

----

*The word Terroir derives as a French term used to describe environmental factors that affect a crop's phenotype. These
such crops consist of many of the finer things in life, including wine, tobacco, and even chocolate. All the
characteristics that make up a terroir give the crop a distinctive character. Terroir even references this character.*

# CAUTION

Terroir is currently in the planning stage and not recommended now or the considerable future for the use in serious
commercial projects. The API will undergo considerable changes over this period.

----

Terroir is planned to be a simple but powerful tool to create interactive 2D video games and experiences without
worrying about cross-platform compatibility featuring first-class support for both Windows and Linux.

Overall, the main goal is to provide a thorough interface that focuses and emphasizes on Modern C++'s as a language
while providing an API that allows the developer to expand the engine's functionality through custom plugins.

This plugin based API will allow the developer multiple choices how deep down the abstraction level they wish to go to
not just make fun games, but also take a deep dive and see how games are made.
